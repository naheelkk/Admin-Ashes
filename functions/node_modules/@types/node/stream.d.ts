/**
 * A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js.
 * The `node:stream` module provides an API for implementing the stream interface.
 *
 * There are many stream objects provided by Node.js. For instance, a `request to an HTTP server` and `process.stdout` are both stream instances.
 *
 * Streams can be readable, writable, or both. All streams are instances of `EventEmitter`.
 *
 * To access the `node:stream` module:
 *
 * ```js
 * const stream = require('node:stream');
 * ```
 *
 * The `node:stream` module is useful for creating new types of stream instances.
 * It is usually not necessary to use the `node:stream` module to consume streams.
 * @see [source](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v20.2.0/lib/stream.js)

         * operating in paused mode. In flowing mode, `readable.read()` is called
         * automatically until the internal buffer is fully drained.
         *
         * ```js
         * const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
         *
         * // 'readable' may be triggered multiple times as data is buffered in
         * readable.on('readable', () => {
         *   let chunk;
         *   console.log('Stream is readable (new data received in buffer)');

         *   console.log('Reached end of stream.');
         * });
         * ```
         *
         * Each call to `readable.read()` returns a chunk of data, or `null`. The chunks
         * are not concatenated. A `while` loop is necessary to consume all data
         * currently in the buffer. When reading a large file `.read()` may return `null`,
         * having consumed all buffered content so far, but there is still more data to
         * come not yet buffered. In this case a new `'readable'` event will be emitted
         * when there is more data in the buffer. Finally the `'end'` event will be
         * emitted when there is no more data to come.
         *
         * Therefore to read a file's whole contents from a `readable`, it is necessary
         * to collect chunks across multiple `'readable'` events:
         *
         * ```js
         * const chunks = [];
         *
         * readable.on('readable', () => {
         *   let chunk;
         *   while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
         *     chunks.push(chunk);
         *   }
         * });
         *
         * readable.on('end', () => {
         *   const content = chunks.join('');
         * });
         * ```
         *
         * A `Readable` stream in object mode will always return a single item from
         * a call to `readable.read(size)`, regardless of the value of the`size` argument.
         *
         * If the `readable.read()` method returns a chunk of data, a `'data'` event will
         * also be emitted.
         *
         * Calling {@link read} after the `'end'` event has
         * been emitted will return `null`. No runtime error will be raised.

         * The `pipeline` API provides a `promise version`.
         *
         * `stream.pipeline()` will call `stream.destroy(err)` on all streams except:
         *
         * * `Readable` streams which have emitted `'end'` or `'close'`.
         * * `Writable` streams which have emitted `'finish'` or `'close'`.

         * `stream.pipeline()` leaves dangling event listeners on the streams
         * after the `callback` has been invoked. In the case of reuse of streams after
         * failure, this can cause event listener leaks and swallowed errors. If the last
         * stream is readable, dangling event listeners will be removed so that the last
         * stream can be consumed later.
         *
         * `stream.pipeline()` closes all the streams when an error is raised.
         * The `IncomingRequest` usage with `pipeline` could lead to an unexpected behavior
         * once it would destroy the socket without sending the expected response.
         * See the example below:
         *
         * ```js
         * const fs = require('node:fs');
         * const http = require('node:http');

         *     if (err) {
         *       console.log(err); // No such file
         *       // this message can't be sent once `pipeline` already destroyed the socket
         *       return res.end('error!!!');
