## Quickstart

### Installing the client library

```bash
npm install google-auth-library
```

## Ways to authenticate
This library provides a variety of ways to authenticate to your Google services.
- [Application Default Credentials](#choosing-the-correct-credential-type-automatically) - Use Application Default Credentials when you use a single identity for all users in your application. Especially useful for applications running on Google Cloud. Application Default Credentials also support workload identity federation to access Google Cloud resources from non-Google Cloud platforms.
- [OAuth 2](#oauth2) - Use OAuth2 when you need to perform actions on behalf of the end user.
- [JSON Web Tokens](#json-web-tokens) - Use JWT when you are using a single identity for all users. Especially useful for server->server or server->API communication.
- [Google Compute](#compute) - Directly use a service account on Google Cloud Platform. Useful for server->server or server->API communication.
- [Workload Identity Federation](#workload-identity-federation) - Use workload identity federation to access Google Cloud resources from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure or any identity provider that supports OpenID Connect (OIDC).
- [Workforce Identity Federation](#workforce-identity-federation) - Use workforce identity federation to access Google Cloud resources using an external identity provider (IdP) to authenticate and authorize a workforce—a group of users, such as employees, partners, and contractors—using IAM, so that the users can access Google Cloud services.
- [Impersonated Credentials Client](#impersonated-credentials-client) - access protected resources on behalf of another service account.
- [Downscoped Client](#downscoped-client) - Use Downscoped Client with Credential Access Boundary to generate a short-lived credential with downscoped, restricted IAM permissions that can use for Cloud Storage.

## Application Default Credentials
This library provides an implementation of [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started)for Node.js. The [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) provide a simple way to get authorization credentials for use in calling Google APIs.

They are best suited for cases when the call needs to have the same identity and authorization level for the application independent of the user. This is the recommended approach to authorize calls to Cloud APIs, particularly when you're building an application that uses Google Cloud Platform.

Application Default Credentials also support workload identity federation to access Google Cloud resources from non-Google Cloud platforms including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure or any identity provider that supports OpenID Connect (OIDC). Workload identity federation is recommended for non-Google Cloud environments as it avoids the need to download, manage and store service account private keys locally, see: [Workload Identity Federation](#workload-identity-federation).

#### Download your Service Account Credentials JSON file

To use Application Default Credentials, You first need to download a set of JSON credentials for your project. Go to **APIs & Auth** > **Credentials** in the [Google Developers Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and select **Service account** from the **Add credentials** dropdown.

> This file is your *only copy* of these credentials. It should never be
> committed with your source code, and should be stored securely.

Once downloaded, store the path to this file in the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

#### Enable the API you want to use

Before making your API call, you must be sure the API you're calling has been enabled. Go to **APIs & Auth** > **APIs** in the [Google Developers Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and enable the APIs you'd like to call. For the example below, you must enable the `DNS API`.


#### Choosing the correct credential type automatically

Rather than manually creating an OAuth2 client, JWT client, or Compute client, the auth library can create the correct credential type for you, depending upon the environment your code is running under.

For example, a JWT auth client will be created when your code is running on your local developer machine, and a Compute client will be created when the same code is running on Google Cloud Platform. If you need a specific set of scopes, you can pass those in the form of a string or an array to the `GoogleAuth` constructor.

The code below shows how to retrieve a default credential type, depending upon the runtime environment.

```js
const {GoogleAuth} = require('google-auth-library');

/**
* Instead of specifying the type of client you'd like to use (JWT, OAuth2, etc)
* this library will automatically choose the right client based on the environment.
*/
async function main() {
  const auth = new GoogleAuth({
    scopes: 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'
  });
  const client = await auth.getClient();
  const projectId = await auth.getProjectId();
  const url = `https://dns.googleapis.com/dns/v1/projects/${projectId}`;
  const res = await client.request({ url });
  console.log(res.data);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## OAuth2

This library comes with an [OAuth2](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2) client that allows you to retrieve an access token and refreshes the token and retry the request seamlessly if you also provide an `expiry_date` and the token is expired. The basics of Google's OAuth2 implementation is explained on [Google Authorization and Authentication documentation](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2Login).

In the following examples, you may need a `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET` and `REDIRECT_URL`. You can find these pieces of information by going to the [Developer Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), clicking your project > APIs & auth > credentials.

For more information about OAuth2 and how it works, [see here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2).

#### A complete OAuth2 example

Let's take a look at a complete example.

``` js
const {OAuth2Client} = require('google-auth-library');
const http = require('http');
const url = require('url');
const open = require('open');
const destroyer = require('server-destroy');

// Download your OAuth2 configuration from the Google

as plain text or in JSON format.

To generate a file-sourced OIDC configuration, run the following command:

```bash
# Generate an OIDC configuration file for file-sourced credentials.
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create-cred-config \
    projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/$POOL_ID/providers/$OIDC_PROVIDER_ID \
    --service-account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \
    --credential-source-file $PATH_TO_OIDC_ID_TOKEN \
    # Optional arguments for file types. Default is "text":
    # --credential-source-type "json" \
    # Optional argument for the field that contains the OIDC credential.
    # This is required for json.
    # --credential-source-field-name "id_token" \
    --output-file /path/to/generated/config.json
```

Where the following variables need to be substituted:
- `$PROJECT_NUMBER`: The Google Cloud project number.
- `$POOL_ID`: The workload identity pool ID.
- `$OIDC_PROVIDER_ID`: The OIDC provider ID.
- `$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`: The email of the service account to impersonate.
- `$PATH_TO_OIDC_ID_TOKEN`: The file path where the OIDC token will be retrieved from.

This will generate the configuration file in the specified output file.

**URL-sourced credentials**
For URL-sourced credentials, a local server needs to host a GET endpoint to return the OIDC token. The response can be in plain text or JSON.
Additional required request headers can also be specified.

To generate a URL-sourced OIDC workload identity configuration, run the following command:

```bash
# Generate an OIDC configuration file for URL-sourced credentials.
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create-cred-config \
    projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/$POOL_ID/providers/$OIDC_PROVIDER_ID \
    --service-account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \
    --credential-source-url $URL_TO_GET_OIDC_TOKEN \
    --credential-source-headers $HEADER_KEY=$HEADER_VALUE \
    # Optional arguments for file types. Default is "text":
    # --credential-source-type "json" \
    # Optional argument for the field that contains the OIDC credential.
    # This is required for json.
    # --credential-source-field-name "id_token" \
    --output-file /path/to/generated/config.json
```

Where the following variables need to be substituted:
- `$PROJECT_NUMBER`: The Google Cloud project number.
- `$POOL_ID`: The workload identity pool ID.
- `$OIDC_PROVIDER_ID`: The OIDC provider ID.
- `$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`: The email of the service account to impersonate.
- `$URL_TO_GET_OIDC_TOKEN`: The URL of the local server endpoint to call to retrieve the OIDC token.
- `$HEADER_KEY` and `$HEADER_VALUE`: The additional header key/value pairs to pass along the GET request to `$URL_TO_GET_OIDC_TOKEN`, e.g. `Metadata-Flavor=Google`.

#### Using External Account Authorized User workforce credentials

[External account authorized user credentials](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-obtaining-short-lived-credentials#browser-based-sign-in) allow you to sign in with a web browser to an external identity provider account via the
gcloud CLI and create a configuration for the auth library to use.

To generate an external account authorized user workforce identity configuration, run the following command:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login --login-config=$LOGIN_CONFIG
```

Where the following variable needs to be substituted:
- `$LOGIN_CONFIG`: The login config file generated with the cloud console or
   [gcloud iam workforce-pools create-login-config](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/iam/workforce-pools/create-login-config)

This will open a browser flow for you to sign in via the configured third party identity provider
and then will store the external account authorized user configuration at the well known ADC location.
The auth library will then use the provided refresh token from the configuration to generate and refresh
an access token to call Google Cloud services.

Note that the default lifetime of the refresh token is one hour, after which a new configuration will need to be generated from the gcloud CLI.
The lifetime can be modified by changing the [session duration of the workforce pool](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/locations.workforcePools), and can be set as high as 12 hours.

#### Using Executable-sourced credentials with OIDC and SAML

**Executable-sourced credentials**
For executable-sourced credentials, a local executable is used to retrieve the 3rd party token.
The executable must handle providing a valid, unexpired OIDC ID token or SAML assertion in JSON format
to stdout.

To use executable-sourced credentials, the `GOOGLE_EXTERNAL_ACCOUNT_ALLOW_EXECUTABLES`
environment variable must be set to `1`.

To generate an executable-sourced workload identity configuration, run the following command:

```bash
# Generate a configuration file for executable-sourced credentials.
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create-cred-config \
    projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/$POOL_ID/providers/$PROVIDER_ID \
    --service-account=$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \
    --subject-token-type=$SUBJECT_TOKEN_TYPE \
    # The absolute path for the program, including arguments.
    # e.g. --executable-command="/path/to/command --foo=bar"
    --executable-command=$EXECUTABLE_COMMAND \
    # Optional argument for the executable timeout. Defaults to 30s.
    # --executable-timeout-millis=$EXECUTABLE_TIMEOUT \
    # Optional argument for the absolute path to the executable output file.
    # See below on how this argument impacts the library behaviour.
    # --executable-output-file=$EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_FILE \
    --output-file /path/to/generated/config.json
```
Where the following variables need to be substituted:
- `$PROJECT_NUMBER`: The Google Cloud project number.
- `$POOL_ID`: The workload identity pool ID.
- `$PROVIDER_ID`: The OIDC or SAML provider ID.
- `$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`: The email of the service account to impersonate.
- `$SUBJECT_TOKEN_TYPE`: The subject token type.
- `$EXECUTABLE_COMMAND`: The full command to run, including arguments. Must be an absolute path to the program.

The `--executable-timeout-millis` flag is optional. This is the duration for which
the auth library will wait for the executable to finish, in milliseconds.
Defaults to 30 seconds when not provided. The maximum allowed value is 2 minutes.
The minimum is 5 seconds.

The `--executable-output-file` flag is optional. If provided, the file path must
point to the 3PI credential response generated by the executable. This is useful
for caching the credentials. By specifying this path, the Auth libraries will first
check for its existence before running the executable. By caching the executable JSON
response to this file, it improves performance as it avoids the need to run the executable
until the cached credentials in the output file are expired. The executable must
handle writing to this file - the auth libraries will only attempt to read from
this location. The format of contents in the file should match the JSON format
expected by the executable shown below.

To retrieve the 3rd party token, the library will call the executable
using the command specified. The executable's output must adhere to the response format
specified below. It must output the response to stdout.

A sample successful executable OIDC response:
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "success": true,
  "token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token",
  "id_token": "HEADER.PAYLOAD.SIGNATURE",
  "expiration_time": 1620499962
}
```

A sample successful executable SAML response:
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "success": true,
  "token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml2",
  "saml_response": "...",
  "expiration_time": 1620499962
}
```
For successful responses, the `expiration_time` field is only required
when an output file is specified in the credential configuration.

A sample executable error response:
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "success": false,
  "code": "401",
  "message": "Caller not authorized."
}
```
These are all required fields for an error response. The code and message
fields will be used by the library as part of the thrown exception.

Response format fields summary:
* `version`: The version of the JSON output. Currently, only version 1 is supported.
* `success`: The status of the response. When true, the response must contain the 3rd party token
     and token type. The response must also contain the expiration time if an output file was specified in the credential configuration.
     The executable must also exit with exit code 0.
     When false, the response must contain the error code and message fields and exit with a non-zero value.
* `token_type`: The 3rd party subject token type. Must be *urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt*,
*urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token*, or *urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml2*.
* `id_token`: The 3rd party OIDC token.
* `saml_response`: The 3rd party SAML response.
* `expiration_time`: The 3rd party subject token expiration time in seconds (unix epoch time).
* `code`: The error code string.
* `message`: The error message.

All response types must include both the `version` and `success` fields.
* Successful responses must include the `token_type` and one of
`id_token` or `saml_response`. The `expiration_time` field must also be present if an output file was specified in
the credential configuration.
* Error responses must include both the `code` and `message` fields.

The library will populate the following environment variables when the executable is run:
* `GOOGLE_EXTERNAL_ACCOUNT_AUDIENCE`: The audience field from the credential configuration. Always present.
* `GOOGLE_EXTERNAL_ACCOUNT_IMPERSONATED_EMAIL`: The service account email. Only present when service account impersonation is used.
* `GOOGLE_EXTERNAL_ACCOUNT_OUTPUT_FILE`: The output file location from the credential configuration. Only present when specified in the credential configuration.
* `GOOGLE_EXTERNAL_ACCOUNT_TOKEN_TYPE`: This expected subject token type. Always present.

These environment variables can be used by the executable to avoid hard-coding these values.

##### Security considerations
The following security practices are highly recommended:
* Access to the script should be restricted as it will be displaying credentials to stdout. This ensures that rogue processes do not gain  access to the script.
* The configuration file should not be modifiable. Write access should be restricted to avoid processes modifying the executable command portion.

Given the complexity of using executable-sourced credentials, it is recommended to use
the existing supported mechanisms (file-sourced/URL-sourced) for providing 3rd party
credentials unless they do not meet your specific requirements.

You can now [use the Auth library](#using-external-identities) to call Google Cloud
resources from an OIDC or SAML provider.

#### Configurable Token Lifetime
When creating a credential configuration with workload identity federation using service account impersonation, you can provide an optional argument to configure the service account access token lifetime.

To generate the configuration with configurable token lifetime, run the following command (this example uses an AWS configuration, but the token lifetime can be configured for all workload identity federation providers):

```bash
# Generate an AWS configuration file with configurable token lifetime.
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create-cred-config \
    projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/$POOL_ID/providers/$AWS_PROVIDER_ID \
    --service-account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \
    --aws \
    --output-file /path/to/generated/config.json \
    --service-account-token-lifetime-seconds $TOKEN_LIFETIME
```

 Where the following variables need to be substituted:
- `$PROJECT_NUMBER`: The Google Cloud project number.
- `$POOL_ID`: The workload identity pool ID.
- `$AWS_PROVIDER_ID`: The AWS provider ID.
- `$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`: The email of the service account to impersonate.
- `$TOKEN_LIFETIME`: The desired lifetime duration of the service account access token in seconds.

The `service-account-token-lifetime-seconds` flag is optional. If not provided, this defaults to one hour.
The minimum allowed value is 600 (10 minutes) and the maximum allowed value is 43200 (12 hours).
If a lifetime greater than one hour is required, the service account must be added as an allowed value in an Organization Policy that enforces the `constraints/iam.allowServiceAccountCredentialLifetimeExtension` constraint.

Note that configuring a short lifetime (e.g. 10 minutes) will result in the library initiating the entire token exchange flow every 10 minutes, which will call the 3rd party token provider even if the 3rd party token is not expired.

## Workforce Identity Federation

[Workforce identity federation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation) lets you use an
external identity provider (IdP) to authenticate and authorize a workforce—a group of users, such as employees,
partners, and contractors—using IAM, so that the users can access Google Cloud services. Workforce identity federation
extends Google Cloud's identity capabilities to support syncless, attribute-based single sign on.

With workforce identity federation, your workforce can access Google Cloud resources using an external
identity provider (IdP) that supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) or SAML 2.0 such as Azure Active Directory (Azure AD),
Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), Okta, and others.

### Accessing resources using an OIDC or SAML 2.0 identity provider

In order to access Google Cloud resources from an identity provider that supports [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/connect/),
the following requirements are needed:
- A workforce identity pool needs to be created.
- An OIDC or SAML 2.0 identity provider needs to be added in the workforce pool.

Follow the detailed [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/configuring-workforce-identity-federation) on how
to configure workforce identity federation.

After configuring an OIDC or SAML 2.0 provider, a credential configuration
file needs to be generated. The generated credential configuration file contains non-sensitive metadata to instruct the
library on how to retrieve external subject tokens and exchange them for GCP access tokens.
The configuration file can be generated by using the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).

The Auth library can retrieve external subject tokens from a local file location
(file-sourced credentials), from a local server (URL-sourced credentials) or by calling an executable
(executable-sourced credentials).

**File-sourced credentials**
For file-sourced credentials, a background process needs to be continuously refreshing the file
location with a new subject token prior to expiration. For tokens with one hour lifetimes, the token
needs to be updated in the file every hour. The token can be stored directly as plain text or in
JSON format.

To generate a file-sourced OIDC configuration, run the following command:

```bash
# Generate an OIDC configuration file for file-sourced credentials.
gcloud iam workforce-pools create-cred-config \
    locations/global/workforcePools/$WORKFORCE_POOL_ID/providers/$PROVIDER_ID \
    --subject-token-type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token \
    --credential-source-file=$PATH_TO_OIDC_ID_TOKEN \
    --workforce-pool-user-project=$WORKFORCE_POOL_USER_PROJECT \
    # Optional arguments for file types. Default is "text":
    # --credential-source-type "json" \
    # Optional argument for the field that contains the OIDC credential.
    # This is required for json.
    # --credential-source-field-name "id_token" \
    --output-file=/path/to/generated/config.json
```
Where the following variables need to be substituted:
- `$WORKFORCE_POOL_ID`: The workforce pool ID.
- `$PROVIDER_ID`: The provider ID.
- `$PATH_TO_OIDC_ID_TOKEN`: The file path used to retrieve the OIDC token.
- `$WORKFORCE_POOL_USER_PROJECT`: The project number associated with the [workforce pools user project](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation#workforce-pools-user-project).

To generate a file-sourced SAML configuration, run the following command:

```bash

The [Google Auth Library Node.js Client API Reference][client-docs] documentation
also contains samples.

## Supported Node.js Versions

Our client libraries follow the [Node.js release schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).
Libraries are compatible with all current _active_ and _maintenance_ versions of
Node.js.
If you are using an end-of-life version of Node.js, we recommend that you update
as soon as possible to an actively supported LTS version.

Google's client libraries support legacy versions of Node.js runtimes on a
best-efforts basis with the following warnings:

* Legacy versions are not tested in continuous integration.
* Some security patches and features cannot be backported.
* Dependencies cannot be kept up-to-date.

Client libraries targeting some end-of-life versions of Node.js are available, and
can be installed through npm [dist-tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag).
The dist-tags follow the naming convention `legacy-(version)`.
For example, `npm install google-auth-library@legacy-8` installs client libraries
for versions compatible with Node.js 8.

## Versioning

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).



This library is considered to be **stable**. The code surface will not change in backwards-incompatible ways
unless absolutely necessary (e.g. because of critical security issues) or with
an extensive deprecation period. Issues and requests against **stable** libraries
are addressed with the highest priority.
